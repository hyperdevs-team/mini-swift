# MasMini-Swift
The minimal expression of a Flux architecture in Swift.

Mini is built with be a first class citizen in Swift applications: **macOS, iOS and tvOS** applications.
With Mini, you can create a thread-safe application with a predictable unidirectional data flow, focusing on what really matters: build awesome applications.

## Usage

- **MasMiniSwift** is a library which aims the ease of the usage of a Flux oriented architecture for Swift applications. Due its Flux-based nature, it heavily relies on some of its concepts like **Store**, **State**, **Dispatcher**, **Action**, **Task** and **Reducer**.

![Architecture](https://i.imgur.com/DioR3i0.png)

### State

- The minimal unit of the architecture is based on the idea of the **State**. **State** is, as its name says, the representation of a part of the application in a moment of time.

- The **State** is a simple `struct` which is conformed of different **Tasks** and different pieces of data that are potentially fulfilled by the execution of those tasks.

- For example:

```swift
struct MyCoolState: State {
    let cool: Bool?
    let coolTask: Task

    init(cool: Bool = nil,
         coolTask: Task = Task()
        ) {
        self.cool = cool
        self.coolTask = coolTask
    }

    // Conform to State protocol
    func isEqual(to other: State) -> Bool {
        guard let state = other as? MyCoolState else { return false }
        return self.cool == state.cool && self.coolTask == state.coolState
    }
}
```

- The core idea of a `State` is its [immutability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object), so once created, no third-party objects are able to mutate it out of the control of the architecture flow.

- As can be seen in the example, a `State`  has a pair of  `Task` + `Result`  *usually* (that can be any object, if any), which is related with the execution of the `Task`. In the example above, `CoolTask` is responsible, through its `Reducer` to fulfill the `Action` with the `Task` result and furthermore, the new `State`.

### Action

- An `Action` is the piece of information that is being dispatched through the architecture. Any `class` can conform to the `Action` protocol, with the only requirement of being unique its name per application.

```swift
class RequestContactsAccess: Action {
  // As simple as this is.
}
```

- `Action`s are free of have some pieces of information attached to them, that's why **Mini** provides the user with two main utility protocols: `CompletableAction`, `EmptyAction` and `KeyedPayloadAction`.

    - A `CompletableAction` is a specialization of the `Action` protocol, which allows the user attach both a `Task` and some kind of object that gets fulfilled when the `Task` succeeds.

    ```swift
    class RequestContactsAccessResult: CompletableAction {

      let requestContactsAccessTask: Task
      let grantedAccess: Bool?

      typealias Payload = Bool

      required init(task: Task, payload: Payload?) {
          self.requestContactsAccessTask = task
          self.grantedAccess = payload
      }
    }
    ```
    - An `EmptyAction` is a specialization of `CompletableAction` where the `Payload` is a `Swift.Never`, this means it only has associated a `Task`.

    ```swift
    class ActivateVoucherLoaded: EmptyAction {

      let activateVoucherTask: Task

      required init(task: Task) {
          self.activateVoucherTask = task
      }
    }
    ```
    - A `KeyedPayloadAction`, adds a `Key` (which is `Hashable`) to the `CompletableAction`. This is a special case where the same `Action` produces results that can be grouped together, tipically, under a `Dictionary` (i.e., an `Action` to search contacts, and grouped by their main phone number).

    ```swift
    class RequestContactLoadedAction: KeyedCompletableAction {

      typealias Payload = CNContact
      typealias Key = String

      let requestContactTask: Task
      let contact: CNContact?
      let phoneNumber: String

      required init(task: Task, payload: CNContact?, key: String) {
          self.requestContactTask = task
          self.contact = payload
          self.phoneNumber = key
      }
    }
    ```
### Store

- A `Store` is the hub where decissions and side-efects are made through the ingoing and outgoing `Action`s. A `Store` is a generic class to inherit from and associate a `State` for it.

- A `Store` may produce `State` changes that can be observed like any other **RxSwift**'s `Observable`. In this way a `View`, or any other object of your choice, can receive new `State`s produced by a certain `Store`.

- A `Store` reduces the flow of a certain amount of `Action`s through the `var reducerGroup: ReducerGroup` property.

- The `Store` is implemented in a way that has two generic requirements, a `State: StateType` and a `StoreController: Disposable`. The `StoreController` is usually a class that contains the logic to perform the `Actions` that might be intercepted by the store, i.e, a group of URL requests, perform a database query, etc.

- Through generic specialization, the `reducerGroup` variable can be rewritten for each case of pair `State` and `StoreController` without the need of subclassing the `Store`.

```swift
extension Store where State == TestState, StoreController == TestStoreController {

    var reducerGroup: ReducerGroup {
        return ReducerGroup { [
            Reducer(of: OneTestAction.self, on: self.dispatcher) { action in
                self.state = self.state.copy(testTask: *.requestSuccess(), counter: *action.counter)
            }
        ] }
    }
}
```

- In the snippet above, we have a complete example of how a `Store` would work. We use the `ReducerGroup` to indicate how the `Store` will intercept `Action`s of type `OneTestAction` and that everytime it gets intercepted, the `Store`'s `State` gets copied (is not black magic üßô‚Äç, is through a set of [Sourcery](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery) scripts that are distributed with this package). 

> If you are using SPM or Carthage, they doesn't really allow to distribute assets with the library, in that regard we recommend to just install `Sourcery` in your project and use the templates that can be downloaded directly from the repository under the `Templates` directory.

- When working with `Store` instances, you may retain a strong reference of its `reducerGroup`, this is done using the `subscribe()`  method, which is a `Disposable` that can be used like below:

```swift
var bag = DisposeBag()
let store = Store<TestState, TestStoreController>(TestState(), dispatcher: dispatcher, storeController: TestStoreController())
store
    .subscribe()
    .disposed(by: bag)
```

### Dispatcher

- The last piece of the architecture is the `Dispatcher`. In an application scope, there should be only one `Dispatcher` alive from which every action is being dispatched.

```swift
let action = TestAction()
dispatcher.dispatch(action, mode: .sync)
```

- With one line, we can notify every `Store` which has defined a reducer for that type of `Action`.
